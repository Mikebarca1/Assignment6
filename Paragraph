The dataset that I chose to use from kaggle was Airlines Traffic Passenger Statistics. The dataset contained information on air traffic 
passenger statistics by each airline. The data includes the number of passengers,the operating airline, the published airline, 
the geographic region,the activity type code, the price category code, the terminal, the boarding area, and the year and month of the flight. 
After I imported the file to notebook, I used many Dataframe functions from pandas, and then I made a new column.
Then i used matplotlib.pyplot and plotly to build 2 visualtions. The first visualization was a correlation matrix and the second one was a bar chart. 
The question that i asked was "What is the count of trips taken within a month?". the answer to that question was provided in the bar chart.
